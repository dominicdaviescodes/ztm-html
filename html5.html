    <h2>Section 4: DEVELOPER FUNDAMENTALS: III</h2>
    <p>Google things you don't understand. understand how things work, don't just copy/paste. The top devs fully
      understand the meaning behind what they do.</p>
    <p>w3schools is a great free resource to use when you are first starting out. However, as we progress through the
      course, I will be introducing you to an even better resource in MDN. For now though, we are going to use w3schools
      since it is very nice and easy to use resource when just getting started. </p>
    <h2>How To Ask Questions</h2>
    <p>Asking questions is a very important skill for a developer. However, in your career you won't always have someone
      to give you all of the answers. Part of being a developer is getting really good at something we call problem
      solving. It is often the most overlooked skill to practice by a beginner. In this course, we want to work on the
      skills that matter, so moving forward, I have a request for you that will have long term positive effects on your
      career:</p>
    <p>
      If you have a question or you don't understand something, do these things in order:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Try Rubber Ducking: <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/">here</a> (all great programmers I know do this)
      </li>
      <li>
        Use google and websites like stackoverflow (there is a video coming up on this) to find your answer. Most likely
        somebody has had your issue before.

    <h3>Why index.html?</h3>
    <p>source: <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/">Lifewire</a></p>
    <p>The reality is that a web server can be configured to recognize any file you want as the default for that site.
      That being the case, it's still a good idea to stick with index.html because it is immediately
      recognized on most servers without any additional configuration needed. Using index.html all but ensures that no
      matter where you choose to host your site, including if you choose to change hosting providers in the future, your
      default homepage will still be recognized and displayed.

    <h3>Absolute and relative paths</h3>
    <h4>Path differences in a web address</h4>
    <p>source: <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001708.htm">computerhope</a></p>
    <p>the Internet absolute path is the domain and the web page on that domain. Web developers creating links to other
      pages can use a relative path if the file their linking from is in the same directory.</p>
    <p>Internet URL absolute path: https://www.computerhope.com/oh.htm</p>
    <p>Internet URL relative path: oh.htm</p>
